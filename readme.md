### What-If Analysis

Test how changes in variables like return rate, sales volume, and implementation costs affect your ROI with interactive sliders and real-time visualization.

The What-If Analysis tool allows you to adjust:

- **Sales Volume Change (%)**: See how changes in sales volume affect both per-unit costs and total savings
- **Return Rate Change (%)**: Adjust the baseline return rate to test sensitivity 
- **Solution Cost Change (%)**: Modify the one-time investment required for implementation
- **Return Reduction Effectiveness (%)**: Test different effectiveness levels for your solution
- **Additional Cost per Item Change (%)**: Adjust the ongoing per-unit costs from the solution
- **Average Sale Price Change (%)**: See how price changes affect margins and return values

Each change dynamically updates all calculations and shows impacts through visual charts, helping you understand which factors most significantly influence your ROI.

### ROI Scoring Methodology

KaizenROI uses a weighted scoring system to evaluate investments:
- 50% - Return on Investment (higher is better)
- 35% - Break-even Time (faster is better)
- 15% - Return Reduction Rate (higher is better)

This provides a balanced view that prioritizes financial returns while also considering implementation speed and impact magnitude.

## üßÆ Key Formulas

- **Return Rate** = (Returns / Sales) √ó 100%
- **Avoided Returns** = Returns √ó Reduction Rate
- **Savings Per Item** = Sale Price - New Unit Cost
- **Annual Savings** = Avoided Returns √ó Savings Per Item
- **Annual Additional Costs** = Additional Cost per Item √ó Annual Sales
- **Net Benefit** = Annual Savings - Annual Additional Costs
- **ROI** = (Net Benefit / Solution Cost) √ó 100%
- **Break-even Time** = Solution Cost / Monthly Net Benefit
